# Sparse-Identification-of-Nonlinear-Dynamic-Systems
This project applies Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to evaluate its effectiveness on 316H stainless steel and alloy 617 material data. The objective is to develop and validate a workflow that can identify, process, and compare dynamic material behaviors using SINDy.
